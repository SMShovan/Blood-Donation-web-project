		<h1>Why Blood Donation?<br></h1>
		<h3>It was noted that there was a real lack of blood in our health system. There is public interest to do to improve this situation.

		BloodDonation offers a solution for identifying blood donors.

		The aim is to provide assistance to the sick and the medical profession that often encounter a shortage of blood.

		This solution allows to connect blood donors and patients or hospitals who need that blood.</h3>
